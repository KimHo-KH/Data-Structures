Welcome to my Data Structures Implementation repository!

Introduction
In this repository, I've implemented fundamental data structures in C++. These implementations are aimed at providing clear, concise, and well-documented code for easy understanding and usage.

List of Data Structures Implemented
Linked List: Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists with common operations.
Stack: Implementation of a stack data structure with push, pop, and peek operations.
Queue: Implementation of a queue data structure with enqueue, dequeue, and peek operations.
Binary Search Tree (BST): Implementation of a binary search tree with insert, delete, and search operations.
Heap: Implementation of a binary heap with heapify, insert, and extract min/max operations.
Hash Table: Implementation of a hash table using separate chaining for collision resolution.
Graph: Basic implementation of a graph data structure with adjacency list representation.
Purpose
These implementations serve as educational resources, aiding in learning fundamental data structures, practicing algorithms, or integrating them into larger projects.

How to Use
Each data structure is contained in its respective C++ file with clear documentation and examples. You can simply clone or download this repository and explore the implementations as needed. Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or report issues.
